# Introdution

The aim of this project is to create an easy-to-use data converter tool able to connect to several types of data sources
and convert data to specific formats or make that data available as a different data source. This conversion (flow)
should be possible to be configured without requiring technical skills from the user. The next diagram shows the main
idea of the requested tool.

- Support for multiple data flows (1:1) (designing and simultaneous execution)
- Support for 3 data sources
- Support for 3 data outputs
- Save/Import/Export your data flows(Presets). This allows your to share the file exported ou save it.
- Stop/Pause/Continue the conversion phase.

## How to Use
